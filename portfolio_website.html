        <p>We were tasked with creating a side-scroller game, based on games like Flappy Bird and Super Mario. My partner and I coded this game, in which the user moves the beetle to collect seeds and avoid rocks. Click on the link below and see if you can beat our reigning high score!</p>

          <td id="AboutMeText">I'm a rising senior at Decatur High School (a 30-minute MARTA ride from AT&T). I want to study math in college and hopefully continue with that as a career, which means computer science will be an integral part of my life. Coming into this summer I had only a little experience with Scratch and Python, but these 7 weeks are teaching me so much more! Follow my progress through the projects I post on this website.</td>
