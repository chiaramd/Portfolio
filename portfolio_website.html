        <p>While messing around with the pen function, I made a program to draw more advanced shapes than the squares and triangles we began with. I drew from my knowledge of polar curves to create flowers, spirals, and limacons. (The more interesting curves are courtesy of the internet.) The most challenging aspect of this project was mapping polar curves onto the coordinate plane, because Scratch only understands x and y. Click on the link to check out my finished project, which allows the user to select many different shapes. Enjoy!</p>

        <p>We were tasked with creating a side-scroller game, based on games like Flappy Bird and Super Mario. My partner and I coded this game, in which the user moves the beetle to collect seeds and avoid rocks. Click on the link below and see if you can beat our reigning high score!</p>

        <p>Language: Arduino C</p>
        <p>After practicing some Arduino C with blinking LED lights and researching Servos, we put our knowledge together to make our robots dance! Second by second, my group choreographed a dance to the soundrack "Cory in the House". We only covered about 30 seconds of the song, but our robot's movements (spinning, rapid back-and-forth movements, and wavy motion) matched the music well. After an afternoon of programming, we presented a robot that could dance to the music!</p>

I want to study math in college and hopefully continue with that as a career, which means computer science will be an integral part of my life. Coming into this summer I had only a little experience with Scratch and Python, but these 7 weeks are teaching me so much more! Follow my progress through the projects I post on this website.</td>
